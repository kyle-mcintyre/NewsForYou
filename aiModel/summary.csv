https://thehill.com/policy/defense/521505-trumps-hunt-for-foreign-policy-wins-hits-russian-wall,"Trump has been leaning on foreign policy accomplishments in the final stretch of the presidential campaign amid heavy criticism of his handling of domestic issues such as the COVID-19 crisis and racial tensions.With time running out before the election, the administration pared down its demands and offered Moscow a deal to extend New START for a year in exchange freezing the U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals at their current sizes.Laura Kennedy, a former U.S. ambassador now on the board at political nonprofit Foreign Policy for America, said both the United States and Russia now appear “more interested in positioning themselves as the reasonable party than they are intent on actually reaching a deal.”",3
